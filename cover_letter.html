        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

        <p>I am writing to express my strong interest in the Platform Software Engineer position at Lucid Motors, as advertised. With a background in Electrical & Computer Engineering and a proven track record of success in system software development, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team.</p>

        <p>During my recent internship at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, I honed my skills in system analysis by developing scripts to assess SD-WAN tunnel performance. My experience in modifying Yocto distribution files to integrate Unified Kernel Image (UKI) into the build aligns closely with the responsibilities outlined in the job description. Additionally, I led the migration from GRUB to a streamlined UEFI bootchain powered by UKI/SecureBoot standards, demonstrating my ability to adapt to new technologies and educate teams on their benefits.</p>

        <p>As a Research Assistant at Ruhr University Bochum, I evaluated the security of protocols and features, particularly focusing on Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) and architectures. My research involved extensive analysis of C/C++ code and hardware testing to identify vulnerabilities and potential exploits. This experience has provided me with a deep understanding of system security and a keen eye for detail when it comes to designing and developing secure software.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, I led the design and development of a Safe Automated Vehicle during my time at Purdue University. This project required extensive electrical and digital debugging, software development, and hardware analysis and testing. As the project lead, I oversaw the entire process, ensuring that the vehicle met all specifications and safety standards. My hands-on experience in building digital systems, debugging, and software development, combined with my ability to work effectively in a team, makes me well-suited for the challenges of the Platform Software Engineer role at Lucid Motors.</p>

        <p>Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to further discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasm can contribute to the success of Lucid Motors. I am available at your earliest convenience for an interview and can be reached at <strong>(561) 345-8323</strong> or via email at <strong>malwake@purdue.edu</strong>.</p>

        <p>Sincerely, <br>
        Mohmmad Sami Alwakeel <br>
        M.S. Electrical & Computer Engineering '24 <br>
        Purdue University <br></p>
