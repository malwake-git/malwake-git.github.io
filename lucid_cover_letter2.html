        Newark, CA 94560</strong></p>

        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

        <p>I am writing to express my strong interest in the Sr. Embedded Development Engineer position at Lucid Motors. With a comprehensive background in Electrical & Computer Engineering, coupled with extensive experience in system software development, hardware design, and embedded systems, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your innovative team.</p>

        <p>Lucid Motors' commitment to leading the future in luxury electric vehicles deeply resonates with me. I am inspired by your dedication to pushing the boundaries of design and technology to create vehicles that redefine the automotive experience. As someone who thrives on challenges and is driven by a desire to make a meaningful impact, I believe that Lucid Motors is the perfect environment for me to grow and contribute.</p>

        <p>Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have acquired valuable experience that closely aligns with the requirements of the Sr. Embedded Development Engineer role:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>During my internship at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, I honed my skills in system analysis and firmware development, which included board bring-up and debugging tasks. Additionally, my role as a Research Assistant at Ruhr University Bochum provided me with a solid foundation in embedded systems and hardware design.</li>
            <li>My coursework at Purdue University, along with hands-on projects like the Safe Automated Vehicle, equipped me with practical experience in working with ARM-based processors and various communication protocols, such as SPI, UART, and I2C. I have also developed test frameworks and automation scripts using Python, demonstrating my ability to develop efficient testing solutions.</li>
            <li>My diverse experiences, from teaching assistant roles to system software engineering internships, have prepared me to excel in dynamic team environments. I am adept at hardware design, interpreting schematics, and discerning between software and hardware issues, skills that I believe are essential for success in the Sr. Embedded Development Engineer role.</li>
        </ul>

	<p>I am eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm to Lucid Motors and contribute to the development of cutting-edge electric vehicles. Thank you for considering my application. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience and can be reached at <strong>(561) 345-8323</strong> or via email at <strong>malwake@purdue.edu</strong>.</p>
